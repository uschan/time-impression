  Rain falls like memories on the glass,
  Blurring the line between now and then.
  
  I trace your name in the condensation,
  Briefly clear, sharp against the grey sky,
  Before the mist reclaims it.
  
  We are but islands in a sea of static.
  Waiting for a break in the clouds.
  
  The city lights smear into bokeh ghosts.
  Everything ephemeral.
  Everything drifting.
  
  Look closer.
  The clarity is fleeting,
  But it was real.
